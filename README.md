# sk2tch engine

The "engine" for last seen online.

I originally had a massive React website that held every single one of my
creative coding sketches. One of the sketches named "horror" eventually became
"last seen online."

I decided to pull out and open source all the common functions I use, as well as
slowly convert it over to Typescript.

It'll be sketches 2, or "sk2tch".
